# Dosely - Medicine Tracker Frontend

This is the frontend application for **Dosely**, a modern medicine inventory tracking system.

> 🤖 **AI-Generated Codebase**
> This entire frontend architecture, design system, and logic was **generated by AI**, meticulously **prompted and engineered by Abu Jubair**.

## 🏗 Architecture & Design

The application is built using **React (Vite)** with **TypeScript**, following a clean, component-based architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. ⚡️ Optimistic UI Updates
The application feels instant because it updates the UI *before* the server responds.
-   **Add Medicine**: Instantly appears in the list.
-   **Rename Stock**: Title updates immediately.
-   **Delete**: Item vanishes instantly (reverts if API fails).

### 2. 📱 Responsive & Premium Design
-   **Mobile-First**: Complex grids (like the Morning/Noon/Evening schedule) stack beautifully on mobile.
-   **Visual Cues**:
    -   **Color Coding**: Red (Low), Orange (Med), Green (High) for stock levels.
    -   **Feedback**: Loading spinners inside buttons during async actions.

### 3. 🔐 Secure Authentication
-   **JWT Handling**: Tokens are stored in `localStorage` and automatically injected into headers via Axios interceptors.
-   **Route Protection**: Unauthenticated users are strictly redirected to `/login` by the `ProtectedRoute` wrapper.

## 🧠 The "Master Prompt" Strategy

This frontend was built using a high-fidelity prompt strategy designed by **Abu Jubair**. The prompt (available in [PROMT.md](../PROMT.md)) explicitly defined:
1.  **Exact File Structure**: Preventing AI hallucination of random folders.
2.  **State Management Rules**: Mandating `Context` for Auth and Local State for UI.
3.  **Strict Visual Hierarchies**: Defining exactly where distinct elements (Dose vs Quantity) should be placed.
4.  **Edge Case Handling**: Specifying logic for 401 errors and infinite scroll boundaries.

## 📦 Setup & Run

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup**
    Create `.env` (or rely on defaults):
    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

3.  **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
